## Laudspeaker - Open Source omni-channel customer messaging. Alternative to Braze / Iterable / One Signal / Customer Io

![app laudspeaker com_flow_onboarding-example (1)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7728266/208761386-5dfe6803-16d1-47ca-98f4-45d77ff6058e.png)

## üî• What makes Laudspeaker cool?

Lauspeaker is the only multi-channel open-source customer messaging workflow software, which is focused on being event triggered, has been built with a visual journey feature from day one and is focused on scalability.

We support email, sms and slack as a channel and have many more channels on our roadmap.

We are planning to build Laudspeaker to work well with the Modern Data Stack, integrating with data warehouses and other services so you can easily import and export data with no fear of lock in or losing control of your data.

## üê• Status

- [x] Public Alpha: Anyone can sign up over at [laudspeaker.com](https://laudspeaker.com) but go easy on us, there are wrinkles and we're just getting started.
- [ ] Public Beta: Stable enough for most non-enterprise use-cases.
- [ ] Public: Production-ready.

We're currently in Public Alpha.

## License

**Laudspeaker** is open source and released under the [MIT License][mit_license], and AGPLv3 licenses (code in separate directories) with the exception of our ee directory (which is currently empty!) but will be under the Laudspeaker Enterprise Edition license. If you can only use MIT licencsed code, you can still use Laudspeaker but with a few fewer features.
