## Issues with paid features

We prefer not to accept external contributions for paid features. If you don't see the feature on your local build, it's most probably paid.

# Feature requests

Raise an issue for these and tag it as such. We love every idea. Please give us as much context on the why as possible.

# Features

We don't, yet, have a prescriptive roadmap laid out.
