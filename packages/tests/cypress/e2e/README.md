All cypress end to end tests go in this directory.

To run all tests, run npm tests:run from the top-level project directory. To run a single test, run npm run test:run --num=<three-digit-test-number>

For any old tests that existed before January 2024, view [here](https://github.com/laudspeaker/laudspeaker/tree/464f6ff479f44720c20cd9bceeab05f0f60f8551/packages/client/cypress) to reference those files as they've been since deleted.
